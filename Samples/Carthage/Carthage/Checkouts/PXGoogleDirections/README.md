## Features
- Supports all features from the Google Directions API as of March 2015 (see here for a full list: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions)
- Available both with modern, Swift-style completion blocks, or Objective-C-style delegation patterns
- Queries are made over HTTPS
- JSON is used behind the scenes to help reduce the size of the responses
- Available through CocoaPods

## Installation
### From Cocoapods
At this time, Cocoapods support for Swift frameworks is still in Beta: http://blog.cocoapods.org/Pod-Authors-Guide-to-CocoaPods-Frameworks/.

To use PXGoogleDirections in your project add the following 'Podfile' to your project:

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

platform :ios, '8.0'

pod 'PXGoogleDirections'

use_frameworks!
```

Then run the following command from the Terminal:

```bash
pod install
```

Now, from your code, you should be able to simply import the module like this:

```swift
import PXGoogleDirections
```

> As CocoaPods is still in 0.36 Beta, Swift is not yet finished and I'm not quite yet an expert in Cocoapods, please come back to me if you face any problem using this SDK in your project...

### From source
 - Clone the repository
 - Add the whole `PXGoogleDirections` project to your own Xcode project
 - Add a dependency between the two projects and build

## Usage
Quick-start in two lines of Swift code:

 1) Create an API object:
```swift
let directionsAPI = PXGoogleDirections(apiKey: "<insert your Google API key here>",
                                         from: PXLocation.CoordinateLocation(CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(37.331690, -122.030762)),
                                           to: PXLocation.NamedLocation("Googleplex", "Mountain View", "United States")
```
 2) Run the Directions request:
```swift
directionsAPI.calculateDirections( (response) -> Void in {
    // Do your work here
})
```

See "Documentation" below for more information on the available properties and response data.

## Requirements
 - Runs on iOS 8 at least, or above.
 - Compatible with Swift 1.2 and Xcode 6.3.
 - The SDK depends on the official Google Maps SDK for iOS (more information here: [Google Maps iOS SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/))

## Documentation
(TODO)
I'm working on a sample project to hepl getting you started with the library...
